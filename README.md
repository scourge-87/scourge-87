- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @scourge-87
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...$about-nothing
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...$how-fucking-stupid can Criminal Mind be ? :D surprice surprice.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... We will see, what will happen next week :(
- üì´ How to reach me ...  email, phone call. through my system.. [work in proggress... Server is down, because of maintanance tasks.]


Part of the maintanance routine is writing this thing.

Few of my group actually does have knowledge of this, but not all of them.

Pretty stupid thing right - that my first employed worker, thought that HE CAN FIRE HIS BOSS?!

Whatta fuck?! 
That guy is just fucking absolutely mental - or there has been missunderstanding.

What's your Take? - "The Bossman says"  ;

- dude..
At this point - it should be really fucking obvious - to you [the other side] that I knew - where and what - whent down.

I tried to brief you in as quick as I can - and you could not handle it.

It's ok - I knew that it would happen - but You - And only You - decided -to be that fucking challenging to me?

Why? 

Because you thought that YOUR BOSS -don't know what he's doing?!

Stupid - right?

Yea, I know.. But sometimes, there is situations like this. Where other side "or both side" - have to make an kompromise - not to fucking fight, if you don't want to end that contract
Instead - try to work together motherfuckers?!

Yo - what the fuck - boss?!!!

I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN YOU.

You can come back - if you change your mind.

1. Be aware - of this
2. I know -what I want you to do
3. I know - what I need you to do - and when - DO NOT MAKE THIS TOO FUCKING DIFFICULT FOR ME 
4. We both would be much more happier - if you could just keep me in the fuckign loop!!!

I have at this moment - in my email boxe's 172 [I REPEAT] 1-7-2 -different scheche's of email's to different people.

One of my folder's in my computer - Can contain more than 28 000 pictures / photographs etc - WHAT ARE MY OWN FUCKING PRODUCTS.

So, dont expect that if YOU [worker] just started - that You would know better how to do business, than your boss.
